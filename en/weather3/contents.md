### Cold colder coldest

What is the longest period of uninterrupted days that had no temperatures above or equal to 0◦C (i.e. **maximum** temperature below 0◦C)? What was the date of the last day of this period of time?

Write a function named `get_longest_freezing()` that returns both the longest number of days with uninterrupted freezing temperatures and the date of the last day of this period. The function should accept two arguments: `max_dates` and `max_temps`. Take a good look at the example of the calls to the functions in assignment 1, and think of logical variable names.

> **Making the problem smaller:** For these next few assignments, use the same small test lists from before and print out any intermediate results, so you can verify the correctness of your algorithm. Try and consider any edge cases for these problems: Can you think of an example where your code *would not* work? Once you're convinced your code works in all cases, you should of course remove any tests prints from your final function.

Print the answer to both questions in one neatly formatted line, such that `checkpy` understands your output. Remember to reuse any formatting functions you wrote before, and do not put your `print` within the function `get_longest_freezing()`.
